# Technical Requirements

### Block Producer recommended specifications

* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
* 8 CPU, 12 Gb RAM, 20 GB HDD
* Use SSH Client, \(iTerm in MacOS or MobaXterm, PuTTY for Windows or others\)

### Snark Worker recommended specifications

{% hint style="info" %}
If you use the **Producer** + **Snark worker** on the same server, you will need more than 16GB RAM. I recommend using a server with 32GB RAM.
